# A self driving vehicle based on evolutionary neural network and reinforcement learning neural network

This program is mean to demonstrate how a self learning autonomous vehicle works, with either evolutionary algorithm or reinforcement learning. That means you can switch between these two methodes.


Start the program with evolutionary methode by running: python Game.py

If you want to start the program with reinforcement learning, run it with:
python Game.py --rl True

You can try to change the game by editing the Config.py file, e.g. change the map size, change the car size etc.

**Result of a evolutionary algorithm test:**

This is the first generation

This is the last generation which has a individual fits the max required fitness

**Rresult of reinfocement learning**

This is one of the tests in the beginning:

This is one test that passed the max required fitness

There is a real-time statistics monitor for reinforcement learning, so you can see how is the current fitness is.

Have fun!
